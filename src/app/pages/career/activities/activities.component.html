      <p class="mt-3 ms-2 fw-bold">Increase capacity and collaboration in insect production and processing</p>

    <div class="d-flex justify-content-start align-items-center">
      <div class="dot"></div>
      <p class="mt-3 ms-2 fw-bold">Investigating, optimising, and scaling up BSF rearing technology</p>
    </div>
    <p class="fw-bold">And so,</p>
    <p class="fw-bold">1- achieving BSF farming, consuming food waste, and providing BSF meal as a feed ingredient for pigs, chickens,
      and fish. In order to close the gap
      <br>
      and meet the rising demand for protein sources, more fish, meat, and eggs were produced.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bold">2- The second by-product (frass) of BSF rearing is used as organic fertiliser because it is enriched with chitin
      and other beneficial elements for the soil,
      <br>
      resulting in higher crop yields (>70%) and higher income.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">EGYMAG outcomes</h2>
    <p class="fw-bold">
      EGYMAG is attempting to deliver outcomes that are in accordance with the (sustainable animal feed, sustainable
      increase in fish, pig and poultry production,
      <br>
      enhancing women and youth employment. increasing income from sale of BSF as feed component by creation of a supply
      chain that did not exist previously).
